# Big Data Management &amp; Analysis
#### Instructed by Proffesor Huy T. Vo, NYU
This repository is a showcase for my coursework in Big Data Management & Analysis during Spring 2019. 

The course aimed to provide a broad understanding of big data and current technologies in managing and
processing them with a focus on the urban environment. Topics included big data ecosystems, parallel and streaming programming model, MapReduce, Hadoop, Spark, Pig, and NoSQL solutions.

Included in this repo are solutions for the following assignments:

* *HW 1: Streaming*
    * Simple cash-register exercise using python to count the count the number of customers per product
* *HW 2: High Order Functions*
    * Practice using pythons high order functions (e.g. map(), filter(), sorted(), & reduce()) using graduation outcome data from NYC's Department of Education.
* *HW 3: MapReduce*
    * Practice using the MapReduce python paradigm using a dataset of emails. Output is a list of "reciprocal" relationships in the company.
* *HW 4: Spark*
    * This serves as an introduction to Apache Spark. The challenge is the same as Homework 3
* *HW 5: Spatial & Spark*
    * Generate spatial statistics for yellow taxi trips in NYC.We are interested to
know for destinations in each borough of New York, i.e. Manhattan, Brooklyn, Queens, Bronx and Staten
Island, the top 3 neighborhoods (e.g. West Village, Williamsburg, Flushing, etc.) that those trips originated
from. 
* *Final Challenge: Visualizing the distribution of drug-abuse-related tweets*
    * Spatially joined tweets that contains drug-related terms with the census tracts, and computed the
normalized number of tweets using the provided boundary and population data. Implemented using
Spark in a scalable way such that if there are additional tweets, or
census tract data available, code can still run efficiently.
